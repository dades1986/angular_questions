# 1. Explain what Angular is.

Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework run on Node.js. 
It is led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. 
Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. 
Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

## C/C Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.

# 2. Which skills are required to use Angular?

To know that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and (of course) Angular knowledge are vital skills required to use Angular?
To be aware that TypeScript and Angular Command Line Interface knowledge is also important.

# 3. Which soft skills do Angular developers need?

Some of the crucial soft skills required to be a skilled Angular developer include empathy, 
time management, communication, and attention to detail.
Teamwork is also vital for Angular developers

# 4. Explain the kind of data binding that Angular deploys.

# 5. Explain how Angular is different from AngularJS.

- Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.
* Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.
+ Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding
+ Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules
+ Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:
  -  Static typing, including Generics
  - Type annotations
  - Dynamic loading
  - Asynchronous template compilations
  - Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS.
  - Support to run Angular applications on servers.


# 6. Explain what a decorator is in Angular.


In Angular, a decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a :
   - class
   -  method
   -  property
   -  or parameter

   Decorators provide a way to add metadata to these structures, which can then be used by Angular to configure and enhance their behavior.

   Decorators are extensively used in Angular to define various aspects of components, directives, services, and other building blocks of an Angular application.

1. Syntax:
   - Decorators are denoted by the '@' symbol followed by an identifier.
   - Examples: @Component, @Directive, @Injectable, etc.

2. Metadata:
   - Decorators attach metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters.
   - This metadata provides information to Angular about how to process and use the associated structure.

3. Role in Angular:
   - Decorators are crucial for Angular's:
        - dependency injection system
        - template compilation
        - and component lifecycle management.
   - They define :
     - component metadata
      -  inject dependencies
      -  specify template and style information
      -   handle events
      -    etc.

4. Built-in Decorators:
   - Angular provides built-in decorators such as:
    
**_1. __@NgModule__: Defines and configures Angular modules.

2. __@Component__: Defines a component along with its metadata.

3. __@Directive__: Declares a directive along with its metadata.

4. __@Pipe__: Marks a class as a pipe for transforming data within a template.

5. __@Injectable__: Marks a class as available to the Angular dependency injection system.

6. __@Input__: Defines an input property for a component or directive.

7. __@Output__: Defines an output property for a component or directive.

8. __@HostBinding__: Binds a host element property to a directive or component property.

9. __@HostListener__: Listens to events on the host element of the directive or component.

10. __@ViewChild__: Queries a single child component, directive, or element within the view of a component.

11. __@ViewChildren__: Queries multiple child components, directives, or elements within the view of a component.

12.__@ContentChild__: Queries a single projected content child within the host component.

13. __@ContentChildren__: Queries multiple projected content children within the host component.

14. __@Host__: Defines that a directive should inject the host element.

15. __@Self__: Restricts the scope of a dependency resolution to a single element.

16. __@SkipSelf__: Skips the current element and tries to resolve a dependency from a parent element.

17. __@Optional__: Specifies that a dependency is optional during injection.

18. __@Attribute__: Injects an attribute value from the host element.

19. __@NgModuleRef__: Injects a reference to the current NgModule.

20. __@ComponentRef__: Injects a reference to the current component.

21. __@PipeMetadata__: Injects metadata about the pipe being instantiated._**


5. Custom Decorators:
   - Custom decorators can be created to encapsulate reusable behavior or apply additional logic to classes, methods, or properties.

6. Use Cases:
   - Decorators are extensively used in Angular applications for defining component and directive metadata, configuring dependency injection, applying styles and templates, handling events, etc.

# 34. Describe some benefits of using Angular.
We should know that Angular’s strength is that it enables developers to write clean code that’s easy to maintain.
We should be aware that Angular provides reusable components and data binding and offers modules that make application creation smoother.
